# tech-blogs
This repository will provide source code for technical blogs at anantvichar.com, a personal blogging web site with technical, hindi and marathi blogs
For Every Blog, we have created a folder corresponding the the blog name in format: <catagory>_<blog_name>_<blog_short_link>
  For example: for a blog in Python the folder name can be Python_Creating_GUI_in_AppJar_tb_c3_b4.
  
  We will provide relevant links in the blogs itself so that you can directly access the folders corresponding to it. Incase you have any difficulty in accessing the folders, you can see the suggested format to search or write out to us at contact@anantvichar.com. 
  
  We have ensured that the code remains upto date and correct. Incase you get any bugs, please let us know by sending a pull request. We will acknowledge those users specially on our github page.
